Uses the MVC Pattern to represent integers in a data model in two different ways: numbers inside text fields and rectangles (TextView and GraphView). Typing a new number in a text field will cause the corresponding rectangle to change its length accordingly, and clicking next to a rectangle will make the rectangle increase/decrease its length to that position - causing the corresponding text field to update as well.
